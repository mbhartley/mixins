An exercise in including mix-ins in CSS for The Iron Yard Academy week 2

This was one of our initial assignments after being introduced to the CSS pre-processor SASS. The mixins
feature of SASS allows us to make CSS declarations that are easily re-used throughout the site. The challenge
we faced in this particular project was knowing when mixins were actually helpful. It was an exercise in learning
to ask the question, "Am I really reducing the amount of code I have to write by using a mixin in this instance?"
